# Postits
A Linux Desktop Stickynotes Application

Stickynotes always was a very useful application when I once was a Windows User. The switch to Linux lost me hundred things, while Sticky Notes was one of them.

Since I had to learn how to Code, this is a small project to bring a beautiful, usable stickynotes Application to the Linux Desktop, especially for GNOME Desktop Environment.

Postits is written using Vala, is in a very early stage, just days old, might not even work on many systems.
